### Game Objects: Understanding Game Blocks in JavaScript

**What are Game Blocks?**
- Game blocks are elements in the game world that can be **static**, **moving**, or define **boundaries**.
- Used to build platforms, create challenges, and enable player interaction.

**Types of Game Blocks:**
- üß± **Static Blocks**: Stay in place. Used for platforms, walls, floors.
- üîÅ **Moving Blocks**: Move along set paths. Add timing and strategy.
- üöß **Boundary Blocks**: Mark the edges of the game world.

**How Are Blocks Used?**
- Represented as visual game objects with position, size, and movement.
- They control how the player can interact with the environment.

**What Can Blocks Do?**
- ‚ú® Define structure: floors, ceilings, and boundaries.
- ‚ùå Block movement: act as barriers or walls.
- üéÅ Enable interactivity: collectible blocks or triggers.
- üéÆ Create gameplay: moving obstacles or timing puzzles.

### Physics System: Gravity in 2D Games

**What Is Gravity?**
- Gravity is a simulated **pulling force** that makes objects fall downward.
- Helps objects behave more naturally in platformers and physics games.

**How Gravity Works:**
- üîΩ **Constant Acceleration**: Pulls objects downward every frame.
- üìà **Velocity Increases Over Time**: Things fall faster as time passes.
- üßÆ **Position Updates**: Falling motion is smooth and continuous.
- ‚õî **Terminal Velocity**: Optional cap on fall speed for balance.

**Why Use Gravity?**
- üåç Makes the game feel realistic and immersive.
- üïπÔ∏è Adds difficulty by requiring players to time jumps and landings.
- üîÑ Enables dynamic interactions between objects and platforms.

### Platformer Game Parts

**Platforms/Blocks/Gravity (Nether): Designing Platforms and Collision Detection**
- üé® Design and place platforms that define movement paths.
- ü§ù Implement collision logic to detect when the player lands on or hits blocks.
- üßó Enable the player to walk, jump, and interact using realistic gravity effects.




```python
%%js
const gravity = true;
const moved = false;
const acceleration = 0.5
let time = 0;
let Yvelocity = 0;
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++){
    if(!moved){
        if (gravity) {
                time += 1;
                Yvelocity += 0.5 + acceleration * time;
                console.log("Y velocity: " + Yvelocity + ", Time: " + time)
            }
        }
    else{
        this.time = 0;
    }
}
console.log('As you can see, the velocity of the block is increasing by a greater ammount every time')
```

# Hack: Bouncing Block Effect

## Objective

Enhance your game by adding a bounce effect to a falling block. When the block falls due to gravity and hits the floor, make it bounce back upward to approximately half of its falling distance. This hack adds an engaging dynamic to your simulation and introduces basic collision response.

const STEP_FACTOR = 100; // 1/nth, or N steps up and across the canvas
const ANIMATION_RATE = 1; // 1/nth of the frame rate
const INIT_POSITION = { x: 0, y: 0 };
