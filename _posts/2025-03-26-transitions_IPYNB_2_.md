### What is a Transition Screen?

A transition screen is a visual element used in applications, games, or websites to provide a smooth transition between different states, pages, or scenes. It enhances the user experience by making the navigation feel seamless and engaging.

#### Key Features of a Transition Screen:
- **Visual Appeal**: Often includes animations, fades, or other effects to make transitions visually pleasing.
- **Contextual Information**: Can display loading indicators, progress bars, or messages to inform users about the ongoing process.
- **Branding Opportunity**: Allows for the inclusion of logos, taglines, or other branding elements.
- **User Engagement**: Keeps users engaged during potentially long loading times or state changes.
- **Smooth Navigation**: Reduces the abruptness of switching between different sections or states.
- **Customizable**: Can be tailored to fit the theme or style of the application or website.

#### Common Use Cases:
- **Loading Screens**: Displayed while content is being loaded in the background.
- **Scene Transitions in Games**: Used to switch between levels or scenes.
- **Page Transitions in Websites**: Smoothly navigate between different pages or sections.
- **Modal Dialogs**: Transition screens can be used to introduce modal dialogs or pop-ups.

#### Benefits of Using Transition Screens:
- Improves the overall user experience.
- Provides feedback to users, reducing frustration during loading times.
- Enhances the aesthetic appeal of the application or website.
- Offers an opportunity to reinforce branding.

Transition screens are a powerful tool to make applications and websites feel polished and professional while keeping users engaged.

## Hack 
### Change the existing transition screen, so that it has a screen saying "Loading..." while fading in and out, instead of a black screen.


```python
%%js
transitionToLevel() {
        const fadeOverlay = document.createElement('div');
        fadeOverlay.style.position = 'fixed';
        fadeOverlay.style.top = '0';
        fadeOverlay.style.left = '0';
        fadeOverlay.style.width = '100%';
        fadeOverlay.style.height = '100%';
        fadeOverlay.style.backgroundColor = 'black';
        fadeOverlay.style.opacity = '0';
        fadeOverlay.style.transition = 'opacity 1s ease-in-out';
        document.body.appendChild(fadeOverlay);
    
        // Fade to black
        requestAnimationFrame(() => {
            fadeOverlay.style.opacity = '1';
        });
    
        setTimeout(() => {
            // Switch levels when screen is black
            const GameLevelClass = this.levelClasses[this.currentLevelIndex];
            this.currentLevel = new GameLevel(this);
            this.currentLevel.create(GameLevelClass);
    
            // Fade back in
            fadeOverlay.style.opacity = '0';
            setTimeout(() => document.body.removeChild(fadeOverlay), 1000);
            
            // Start game loop after transition
            this.gameLoop();
        }, 1000); // Wait for fade-out duration
    }
```
