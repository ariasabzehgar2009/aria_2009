## Starting off 
Here are some places that play a big part in my life 

<style>
    /* Style looks pretty compact, trace grid-container and grid-item in the code */
    .grid-container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(150px, 1fr)); /* Dynamic columns */
        gap: 10px;
    }
    .grid-item {
        text-align: center;
    }
    .grid-item img {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100px; /* Fixed height for uniformity */
        object-fit: contain; /* Ensure the image fits within the fixed height */
    }
    .grid-item p {
        margin: 5px 0; /* Add some margin for spacing */
    }

        .image-gallery {
        display: flex;
        flex-wrap: nowrap;
        overflow-x: auto;
        gap: 10px;
        }

    .image-gallery img {
        max-height: 150px;
        object-fit: cover;
        border-radius: 5px;
    }
    
</style>

<!-- This grid_container class is for the CSS styling, the id is for JavaScript connection -->
<div class="grid-container" id="grid_container">
    <!-- content will be added here by JavaScript -->
</div>

<script>
    // 1. Make a connection to the HTML container defined in the HTML div
    var container = document.getElementById("grid_container"); // This container connects to the HTML div

    // 2. Define a JavaScript object for our http source and our data rows for the Living in the World grid
    var http_source = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/";
    var living_in_the_world = [
        {"flag": "0/01/Flag_of_California.svg", "greeting": "Best state", "description": "Have been living here since 2014 and it is awesome"},
        {"flag": "c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg", "greeting": "Great Childhood", "description": "Lived in Canada for the first 6 years of my life, was where I developed a passion for hockey"},
        {"flag": "c/ca/Flag_of_Iran.svg", "greeting": "Cool Country", "description": "Where my parents were born, occasionally visit it"},
        {"flag": "a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg", "greeting": "America", "description": "Home country in which I travel all around for hockey tournaments"},
    ]; 
    
    // 3a. Consider how to update style count for size of container
    // The grid-template-columns has been defined as dynamic with auto-fill and minmax

    // 3b. Build grid items inside of our container for each row of data
    for (const location of living_in_the_world) {
        // Create a "div" with "class grid-item" for each row
        var gridItem = document.createElement("div");
        gridItem.className = "grid-item";  // This class name connects the gridItem to the CSS style elements
        // Add "img" HTML tag for the flag
        var img = document.createElement("img");
        img.src = http_source + location.flag; // concatenate the source and flag
        img.alt = location.flag + " Flag"; // add alt text for accessibility

        // Add "p" HTML tag for the description
        var description = document.createElement("p");
        description.textContent = location.description; // extract the description

        // Add "p" HTML tag for the greeting
        var greeting = document.createElement("p");
        greeting.textContent = location.greeting;  // extract the greeting

        // Append img and p HTML tags to the grid item DIV
        gridItem.appendChild(img);
        gridItem.appendChild(description);
        gridItem.appendChild(greeting);

        // Append the grid item DIV to the container DIV
        container.appendChild(gridItem);
    }
</script>
### My journey so far in life and fun facts 
- I was born in Vancouver Canada in which I lived in until I was 6
- During this time I developed a huge interest in ice hockey.
- As I arrived in San Diego, I surprisingly fit into the school system and found myself a hockey team pretty fast
- I attended Monterey Ridge Elementary, Oak Valley Middle School, and am a student in Del Norte in the class of 2027
- I am now playing a high level of hockey which requires me to be very responsible to be able to manage work
- I am currently interested in Chemistry and Computer Science and find these two subjects most amusing.
- If I'm not playing hockey or studying, I am usually playing fortnite, or hanging out with friends and family.

### Family Matters
- My parents are both from Iran which is a cool country if you really get to know it
- My brother was born in San Diego unlike me. He currently attends MRES and is a great hockey player as well.
- My grandparents all live in Iran, and we as family attempt to visit them once a year, which is a difficult task considering the distance.
- My gallery below has some cool pictures both from me and my family friends.
