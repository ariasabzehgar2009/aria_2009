    "**What are Game Blocks?**\n",
    "- Game blocks are elements in the game world that can be **static**, **moving**, or define **boundaries**.\n",
    "- Used to build platforms, create challenges, and enable player interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Game Blocks:**\n",
    "- 🧱 **Static Blocks**: Stay in place. Used for platforms, walls, floors.\n",
    "- 🔁 **Moving Blocks**: Move along set paths. Add timing and strategy.\n",
    "- 🚧 **Boundary Blocks**: Mark the edges of the game world.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Are Blocks Used?**\n",
    "- Represented as visual game objects with position, size, and movement.\n",
    "- They control how the player can interact with the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Can Blocks Do?**\n",
    "- ✨ Define structure: floors, ceilings, and boundaries.\n",
    "- ❌ Block movement: act as barriers or walls.\n",
    "- 🎁 Enable interactivity: collectible blocks or triggers.\n",
    "- 🎮 Create gameplay: moving obstacles or timing puzzles.\n",

    "**What Is Gravity?**\n",
    "- Gravity is a simulated **pulling force** that makes objects fall downward.\n",
    "- Helps objects behave more naturally in platformers and physics games.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Gravity Works:**\n",
    "- 🔽 **Constant Acceleration**: Pulls objects downward every frame.\n",
    "- 📈 **Velocity Increases Over Time**: Things fall faster as time passes.\n",
    "- 🧮 **Position Updates**: Falling motion is smooth and continuous.\n",
    "- ⛔ **Terminal Velocity**: Optional cap on fall speed for balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Use Gravity?**\n",
    "- 🌍 Makes the game feel realistic and immersive.\n",
    "- 🕹️ Adds difficulty by requiring players to time jumps and landings.\n",
    "- 🔄 Enables dynamic interactions between objects and platforms.\n",
